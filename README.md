I know, I know, I committed the whole project at once. At first, I thought it was going to be a junk project, so I didn't start it with Git

<h2>Beta Version: A Simple & Unique Volume Controller for CMF Series</h2>
At this time, the app is still buggy and unstable—it's in beta, or maybe even pre-beta! 😄
My goal is to create a unique, simple volume controller with a minimalist dot-style design, and this app is my first attempt and step in that direction.
I developed this app specifically for the CMF series.
I hope you enjoy using it and feel free to help improve it! 🙌

<h2>security issue on Android (in pre-beta release)</h2>
<p>
If you encounter a security issue on Android that prevents you from granting permissions to the app, go to the app settings,
tap on the three dots in the top right, and select "Allow Restricted Settings."
