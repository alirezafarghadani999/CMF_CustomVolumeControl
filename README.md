I know, I know, I committed the whole project at once. At first, I thought it was going to be a junk project, so I didn't start it with Git

<h2>Beta Version: A Simple & Unique Volume Controller for CMF Series</h2>
At this time, the app is still buggy and unstable—it's in beta, or maybe even pre-beta! 😄
My goal is to create a unique, simple volume controller with a minimalist dot-style design, and this app is my first attempt and step in that direction.
I developed this app specifically for the CMF series.
I hope you enjoy using it and feel free to help improve it! 🙌
